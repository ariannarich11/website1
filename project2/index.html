  <h1 id="title">How the Covid-19 Pandemic <br>Raised Global Awareness on<br><span> Police Brutality</span>
  </h1>
  <div class="page1">



    <h2> What is Police Brutality in the United states?</h2>
    <p> As defined by Britannica: “the unwarranted or excessive and often
      illegal use of force against civilians by U.S. police officers.
      Forms of police brutality have ranged from assault and battery (e.g., beatings) to mayhem, torture, and murder.
      Some broader definitions of police brutality also encompass harassment (including false arrest), intimidation, and
      verbal abuse, among other forms of mistreatment.”


      <br>The instance of police brutality is even more concerning when the <a
          href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/05/871083599/the-history-of-police-in-creating-social-order-in-the-u-s."><span>racist history</span></a>
         of policing is brought to light.

    </p>
    <h2>Who is Primarily Affected?</h2>
    <p>Anyone can be a victim of police brutality.
      However, African Americans are at a higher
      risk of death by the hands of a cop than any
      other racial group. Although African Americans
      are only 13 percent of the population, they are disproportionately affected by police brutality compared to any
      other ethnicity in the country.
    </p>
    <h2> Lasting Effects of Brutality in the African American Community</h2>
    <p>
      “Black communities are often over-policed and over-profiled, which can even lead to fatality, as recent cases have
      shown us,” said Dr. Michael Lindsey, who directs the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at New
      York University…”

      <br>The repercussions of police brutality are countless in the Black community, however, a significant byproduct
      of this issue is a general distrust in the police.

      <br> In addition, there are also negative effects on the mental health of black youth caused by racism and racial
      disparities.

      <br> It is not uncommon for Black parents to initiate a discussion with their children regarding the procedure if
      they ever find themselves in a dangerous situation with law enforcement. As police brutality poses a discernible
      threat to Black households, black children are taught that they are seen as a threat from a young age. Dr.
      Adrienne Clark, an Adolescent psychiatrist spoke on how significant age can be on NPR: '"So you might think, 'I'm
      16; I'm playing around,'" Clark says. "But get them to understand: You might be perceived as an adult.'" To
      further prove her point, Clark also referenced that the American Psychology Association had conducted research
      finding that police officers generally view Black males as more dangerous as they grow older than any other racial
      counterpart.

    <h2> How Does the Pandemic Come Into Play?
    </h2>
    <p> In a Washington Post article, Maneesh Arora, an assistant professor at Wellesley College conducted her own
      research to discern why an abundance of people protested this year during the George Floyd Protests: “The pandemic
      may also be increasing protest attendance because people have had more free time, because they may not be able to
      work and a variety of social outlets have been banned. About 65 percent of respondents agreed that they had more
      free time during the pandemic.”

      <br> Arora noted that a significant amount of people protested who have suffered financially due to lockdown,
      however, there was another reason: more free time.

      <br> As quarantine had caused many businesses and organizations to close down, this left a great sum of people
      jobless, and with more free time, people utilized this time to protest police brutality.
