            <p>COVID-19 shutdowns had forced the U.S into quarantine, shutting down schools, jobs, public places of recreation and etc. As Americans were stuck at home, more eyes were glued to the screen in hopes of updates on the virus. However, with the increase of viewership, news reports on police brutality were put on blast to a greater audience. 

                Graphic videos of people suffering at the hands of officers went viral, not just in the U.S, but also across the globe as well. And as George Floyd’s death exposed the horrors of police brutality in such a vivid way, the video documenting it had incited outrage on an international scale. Because more Americans had become face-to-face with these videos more people sought to protest, calling for police reform and justice for those who had died. 
                
                But Amereicans weren’t the only ones who seeked justice, protests had emerged in many countries around the world including: Denmark, Italy, Britain, France and many more.
