       <h1>Victims</h1>

        <p >The list of lives taken by police brutality is endless. In fact,
            there are so many casualties, that The Washington Post had made a <span><a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/ > database</a></span> on brutality victims
            that have died since 2014. However, in regards to this year specifically, the most commonly known victims
            are Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and Ahmaud Arbery.
        </p>
        <h2>George Floyd</h2>

        <p> Although the video of Ahmaud Arbery’s death and the lack
            of brought upon the two men responsible appalled America,
            George Floyd’s death ignited a call for change.
            The video of his death shown to the world at home had initiated the protests,
            and eventually, the riots. Three police officers had killed him in such an inhumane way,
            and initially, didn’t face any serious consequences. And unfortunately, more often than not,
            police officers were the ones who would escalate peaceful protests into violence.
            Whether they were shooting rubber bullets at crowds, spraying teargas into the masses,
            or forcefully arresting innocent people, the police’s actions only further proved that
            police brutality is a major issue in modern-day America.
